<p>Ben had the misfortune of going first again to show the others the ropes, followed by Fernando and Johnny. Let's check how they did!</p>

<blockquote>4. Released in 2006, the iPod Radio Remote was an attachment for then-new iPods that was shaped like a then-unreleased clip-style iPod Shuffle, that allowed compatible iPod users to use their iPods as an FM Radio tuner.</blockquote>

<p>Johnny doubted this product ever existed and was the compiler error, but unfortunately it was a <em>code completion</em>! <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2006/01/10Apple-Announces-the-iPod-Radio-Remote/">Learn More ‚Üí</a></p>

<blockquote>3. Known now as a feature that allows videos to be quickly taken by pressing and holding the shutter button on modern iPhones, the Apple QuickTake was a line of video cameras that could be used tethered to a Mac, or on the go thanks to AA batteries.</blockquote>

<p>Fernando fumbled last minute and chose this as the error, but it was also a <em>code completion</em>! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_QuickTake">Learn More ‚Üí</a></p>

<blockquote>2. Available for sale for just a couple years, iPod Socks were a series of pouches for iPods woven like socks, and came as a package with six colors: grey, orange, pink, blue, green, and purple. For a limited time, they were also available in human sizes at the Apple Company Store in Cupertino.</blockquote>

<p>Everyone thought this was true, but it was in fact the <strong>compiler error</strong>, since iPod socks were not only available for sale for nearly a decade, but were unfortunately never available in human sizes‚Ä¶ <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/12/09/26/apple-removes-ipod-socks-from-online-store">Learn More ‚Üí</a></p>

<p>Which means that‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>1. A key player in pioneering the digital publishing space, Apple made several printer models in 80s and 90s such as the popular ImageWriter and LaserWriter, but they also made the Apple 410 Color Plotter, a printer that used a stylus along with a selection of inks to literally draw shapes and text on the page.</blockquote>

<p>‚Ä¶which Ben thought was a bit too outlandish, was still a <em>code completion</em>! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_410_Color_Plotter">Learn More ‚Üí</a></p>

<p>Ben went first, followed by Spencer. Let's check how they did!</p>

<blockquote>4. Despite being used on some of the earliest computers, the shift modifier on Apple keyboards simply uses the <code>UPWARDS WHITE ARROW</code> character, an approximation of the standardized Level 2 Select key‚Äôs original symbol.</blockquote>

<p>Everyone thought this was true, and it is indeed a <em>code completion</em>! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key">Learn More ‚Üí</a></p>

<blockquote>3. Located between the control and command keys on the keyboard, the option key is unoriginally called <code>OPTION KEY</code> in the unicode specification, but was also known as the ‚Äúclosed apple key‚Äù on Apple II series computers.</blockquote>

<p>Spencer thought this was true, while Ben thought this was the error, but it was also a <em>code completion</em>! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_key">Learn More ‚Üí</a></p>

<blockquote>2. Used on many systems that are very different from Macs, the control key on Mac OS differentiates itself from the competition by using the <code>UP ARROWHEAD</code> unicode character rather than the abbreviation, bar, or traditional caret notations.</blockquote>

<p>Spencer thought this was the error, but it was also a <em>code completion</em>! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key">Learn More ‚Üí</a></p>

<p>Which means that‚Ä¶</p>

<blockquote>1. Known as the key with the apple logo, the command key has been represented by the unicode character known as <code>PLACE OF INTEREST SIGN</code> since the Macintosh introduced in 1984, though the command key itself was present on the Apple III introduced in 1980, but it was represented by an open Apple logo instead.</blockquote>
