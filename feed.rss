<p>Ben went first, followed by Spencer. Let's check how they did!</p>

<blockquote>4. Despite being used on some of the earliest computers, the shift modifier on Apple keyboards simply uses the <code>UPWARDS WHITE ARROW</code> character, an approximation of the standardized Level 2 Select key’s original symbol.</blockquote>

<p>Everyone thought this was true, and it is indeed a <em>code completion</em>! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shift_key">Learn More →</a></p>

<blockquote>3. Located between the control and command keys on the keyboard, the option key is unoriginally called <code>OPTION KEY</code> in the unicode specification, but was also known as the “closed apple key” on Apple II series computers.</blockquote>

<p>Spencer thought this was true, while Ben thought this was the error, but it was also a <em>code completion</em>! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_key">Learn More →</a></p>

<blockquote>2. Used on many systems that are very different from Macs, the control key on Mac OS differentiates itself from the competition by using the <code>UP ARROWHEAD</code> unicode character rather than the abbreviation, bar, or traditional caret notations.</blockquote>

<p>Spencer thought this was the error, but it was also a <em>code completion</em>! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key">Learn More →</a></p>

<p>Which means that…</p>

<blockquote>1. Known as the key with the apple logo, the command key has been represented by the unicode character known as <code>PLACE OF INTEREST SIGN</code> since the Macintosh introduced in 1984, though the command key itself was present on the Apple III introduced in 1980, but it was represented by an open Apple logo instead.</blockquote>

<p>is in fact the <strong>compiler error</strong>! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_key">Learn More →</a></p>
